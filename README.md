**PhoenixGo** is a Go AI program which implements the AlphaGo Zero paper
"[Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge](https://deepmind.com/documents/119/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf)".
It is also known as "BensonDarr" and "金毛测试" in [FoxGo](http://weiqi.qq.com/), 
"cronus" in [CGOS](http://www.yss-aya.com/cgos/), and the champion of 
[World AI Go Tournament 2018](http://weiqi.qq.com/special/109) held in Fuzhou China.

## Building and Running

### On Linux

#### Requirements

* GCC with C++11 support
* Bazel (**0.11.1 is known-good**)
* (Optional) CUDA and cuDNN for GPU support 
* (Optional) TensorRT (for accelerating computation on GPU, 3.0.4 is known-good)

The following environments have also been tested by independent contributors : 
[here](/docs/tested-versions.md). Other versions may work, but they have not been 
tested (especially for bazel).

#### Download and Install Bazel 

Before starting, you need to download and install bazel,
see [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).

For PhoenixGo, bazel (**0.11.1 is known-good**), read 
[Requirements](#requirements) for details

If you have issues on how to install or start bazel, you may want 
to try this all-in-one command line for easier building instead, see
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md#b0-it-is-too-hard-to-install-bazel-or-start-bazel)

#### Building PhoenixGo with Bazel

Clone the repository and configure the building:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo.git
$ cd PhoenixGo
$ ./configure
```

`./configure` will start the bazel configure : ask where CUDA 
and TensorRT have been installed, specify them if need.

Then build with bazel:

```
$ bazel build //mcts:mcts_main
```

Dependices such as Tensorflow will be downloaded automatically. 
The building process may take a long time.

Recommendation : the bazel building uses a lot of RAM, 
if your building environment is lack of RAM, you may need to restart 
your computer and exit other running programs to free as much RAM 
as possible.

#### Running PhoenixGo

Download and extract the trained network:

```
$ wget https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/releases/download/trained-network-20b-v1/trained-network-20b-v1.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf trained-network-20b-v1.tar.gz
```

The PhoenixGo engine supports GTP 
[(Go Text Protocol)](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoTextProtocol),
which means it can be used with a GUI with GTP capability, such as 
[Sabaki](http://sabaki.yichuanshen.de).
It can also run on command-line GTP server tools like 
[gtp2ogs](https://github.com/online-go/gtp2ogs).

But PhoenixGo does not support all GTP commands, see 
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a11-gtp-command-error--invalid-command).

There are 2 ways to run PhoenixGo engine

##### 1) start.sh : easy use

Run the engine : `scripts/start.sh`

`start.sh` will automatically detect the number of GPUs, run `mcts_main` 
with proper config file,
and write log files in directory `log`.

You could also use a customized config file (.conf) by running 
`scripts/start.sh {config_path}`.
If you want to do that, see also [#configure-guide](#configure-guide).

##### 2) mcts_main : fully control

If you want to fully control all the options of `mcts_main` (such 
as changing log destination, or if start.sh is not compatible for your 
specific use), you can run directly `bazel-bin/mcts/mcts_main` instead.

For a typical usage, these command line options should be added:
- `--gtp` to enable GTP mode
- `--config_path=replace/with/path/to/your/config/file` to specify the 
path to your config file
- it is also needed to edit your config file (.conf) and manually add 
the full path to ckpt, see 
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a5-ckptzerockpt-20b-v1fp32plan-error-no-such-file-or-directory).
You can also change options in config file, see 
[#configure-guide](#configure-guide).
- for other command line options , see also 
[#command-line-options](#command-line-options) 
for details, or run `./mcts_main --help` . A copy of the `--help` is 
provided for your convenience [here](/docs/mcts-main-help.md)

For example:

```
$ bazel-bin/mcts/mcts_main --gtp --config_path=etc/mcts_1gpu.conf --logtostderr --v=0
```

#### (Optional) : Distribute mode

PhoenixGo support running with distributed workers, if there are GPUs 
on different machine.

Build the distribute worker:

```
$ bazel build //dist:dist_zero_model_server
```

Run `dist_zero_model_server` on distributed worker, **one for each GPU**.

```
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES={gpu} bazel-bin/dist/dist_zero_model_server --server_address="0.0.0.0:{port}" --logtostderr
```

Fill `ip:port` of workers in the config file (`etc/mcts_dist.conf` is an 
example config for 32 workers), and run the distributed master:

```
$ scripts/start.sh etc/mcts_dist.conf
```

### On macOS

**Note: Tensorflow stop providing GPU support on macOS since 1.2.0, so you are only able to run on CPU.**

#### Use Pre-built Binary

Download and extract 
[CPU-only version (macOS)](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/releases/download/mac-x64-cpuonly-v1/PhoenixGo-mac-x64-cpuonly-v1.tgz)

Follow the document included in the archive : using_phoenixgo_on_mac.pdf

#### Building from Source

Same as Linux.

### On Windows

Recommendation: See [FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a4-syntax-error-windows), 
to avoid syntax errors in config file and command line options on Windows.

#### Use Pre-built Binary

##### GPU version :

The GPU version is much faster, but works only with compatible nvidia GPU.
It supports this environment : 
- CUDA 9.0 only
- cudnn 7.1.x (x is any number) or lower for CUDA 9.0
- no AVX, AVX2, AVX512 instructions supported in this release (so it is 
currently much slower than the linux version)
- there is no TensorRT support on Windows

Download and extract 
[GPU version (Windows)](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/releases/download/win-x64-gpu-v1/PhoenixGo-win-x64-gpu-v1.zip)

Then follow the document included in the archive : how to install 
phoenixgo.pdf

note : to support special features like CUDA 10.0 or AVX512 for example, 
you can build your own build for windows, see 
[#79](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/79)

##### CPU-only version : 

If your GPU is not compatible, or if you don't want to use a GPU, you can download this 
[CPU-only version (Windows)](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/releases/download/win-x64-cpuonly-v1/PhoenixGo-win-x64-cpuonly-v1.zip), 

Follow the document included in the archive : how to install 
phoenixgo.pdf

## Configure Guide

Here are some important options in the config file:

* `num_eval_threads`: should equal to the number of GPUs
* `num_search_threads`: should a bit larger than `num_eval_threads * eval_batch_size`
* `timeout_ms_per_step`: how many time will used for each move
* `max_simulations_per_step`: how many simulations(also called playouts) will do for each move
* `gpu_list`: use which GPUs, separated by comma
* `model_config -> train_dir`: directory where trained network stored
* `model_config -> checkpoint_path`: use which checkpoint, get from `train_dir/checkpoint` if not set
* `model_config -> enable_tensorrt`: use TensorRT or not
* `model_config -> tensorrt_model_path`: use which TensorRT model, if `enable_tensorrt`
* `max_search_tree_size`: the maximum number of tree nodes, change it depends on memory size
* `max_children_per_node`: the maximum children of each node, change it depends on memory size
* `enable_background_search`: pondering in opponent's time
* `early_stop`: genmove may return before `timeout_ms_per_step`, if the result would not change any more
* `unstable_overtime`: think `timeout_ms_per_step * time_factor` more if the result still unstable
* `behind_overtime`: think `timeout_ms_per_step * time_factor` more if winrate less than `act_threshold`

Options for distribute mode:

* `enable_dist`: enable distribute mode
* `dist_svr_addrs`: `ip:port` of distributed workers, multiple lines, one `ip:port` in each line
* `dist_config -> timeout_ms`: RPC timeout

Options for async distribute mode:

> Async mode is used when there are huge number of distributed workers (more than 200),
> which need too many eval threads and search threads in sync mode.
> `etc/mcts_async_dist.conf` is an example config for 256 workers.

* `enable_async`: enable async mode
* `enable_dist`: enable distribute mode
* `dist_svr_addrs`: multiple lines, comma sperated lists of `ip:port` for each line
* `num_eval_threads`: should equal to number of `dist_svr_addrs` lines
* `eval_task_queue_size`: tunning depend on number of distribute workers
* `num_search_threads`: tunning depend on number of distribute workers

Read `mcts/mcts_config.proto` for more config options.

## Command Line Options

`mcts_main` accept options from command line:

* `--config_path`: path of config file
* `--gtp`: run as a GTP engine, if disable, gen next move only
* `--init_moves`: initial moves on the go board, for example usage, see 
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a8-how-make-phoenixgo-start-at-other-position-at-move-1-and-after)
* `--gpu_list`: override `gpu_list` in config file
* `--listen_port`: work with `--gtp`, run gtp engine on port in TCP protocol
* `--allow_ip`: work with `--listen_port`, list of client ip allowed to connect
* `--fork_per_request`: work with `--listen_port`, fork for each request or not

Glog options are also supported:

* `--logtostderr`: log message to stderr
* `--log_dir`: log to files in this directory
* `--minloglevel`: log level, 0 - INFO, 1 - WARNING, 2 - ERROR
* `--v`: verbose log, `--v=1` for turning on some debug log, `--v=0` to turning off

`mcts_main --help` for more command line options.
A copy of the `--help` is provided for your convenience 
[here](/docs/mcts-main-help.md)

## Analysis

For analysis purpose, an easy way to display the PV (variations for 
main move path) is `--logtostderr --v=1` which will display the main 
move path winrate and continuation of moves analyzed, see 
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a2-where-is-the-pv-analysis-) for details

It is also possible to analyse .sgf files using analysis tools such as :
- [GoReviewPartner](https://github.com/pnprog/goreviewpartner) : 
an automated tool to analyse and/or review one or many .sgf files 
(saved as .rsgf file). It supports PhoenixGo and other bots. See 
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a25-how-to-analyzereview-one-or-many-sgf-files-with-goreviewpartner) 
for details
