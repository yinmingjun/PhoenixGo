To reduce phoenixgo size and building time, it is wise to remove all 
the uneeded options during the bazel `./configure` , as was discussed 
here : [#76](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/76)

This is an example of minimalist options that you can use : 

note : if you have trouble with path configurations, see 
[path-errors](/docs/path-errors.md)

```
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]: 


Found possible Python library paths:
  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages]
