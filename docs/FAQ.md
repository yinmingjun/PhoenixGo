### General Questions (windows/mac/linux):

#### A1. Where is the win rate?

Print in the log, something like:

<pre>
I0514 12:51:32.724236 14467 mcts_engine.cc:157] 1th move(b): dp, <b>winrate=44.110905%</b>, N=654, Q=-0.117782, p=0.079232, v=-0.116534, cost 39042.679688ms, sims=7132, height=11, avg_height=5.782244, global_step=639200
</pre>

#### A2. Where is the PV (Analysis) ?

It is possible to display the PV (variation of move path with continuation of the moves)

An easy way to do that is for example to increase verbose level, for example `--logtostderr --v=1` 
(on windows the syntax is different, see [FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md#a4-syntax-error-windows) for details

result is something like this (in this example there are 7000 simulations per move) :

```

```

It is also possible to develop all the tree by adding these lines to your config file :

```
debugger {
    print_tree_depth: 6
    print_tree_width: 6
}
```

In this example, a tree of 6 depth 6 width moves will be printed

#### A2.5 How to analyze/review one or many sgf file(s) with GoReviewPartner

Support is still in testing, but so far these are the recommended settings to do use PhoenixGo with GoReviewPartner

2 config files are provided to you using optimized settings for grp (GoReviewPartner)
- with tensorrt (linux only) : [mcts_1gpu_grp.conf](/etc/mcts_1gpu_grp.conf)
- without tensorrt (linux, mac, windows, gpu or cpu version) :
 [mcts_1gpu_notensorrt_grp.conf](/etc/mcts_1gpu_notensorrt_grp.conf)
 
note : it is also possible with multiple GPU, only the most common examples were shown here

if you want to do the changes manually, you need to :

in phoenixgo .conf config file :

- disable all time settings in config file (set to `0`)
- set time to unlimited (set timeout to 0 ms)
- use simulations per move to have fixed computation per move (playouts), because it 
is not needed to play fast since this is an analysis, unlimited time
- for the same reason, set `enable background search` to 0 (disable pondering), because this is not a live game, 
time settings are not needed and can cause conflicts
- add debug width and height with `debugger` in config file, see previous FAQ question

in grp (GoReviewPartner) settings :
- it is easier to use one of the pre-made grp profile in config.ini (slightly modify them if needed)

Don't forget to add paths in the config file as explained in 
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a5-ckptzerockpt-20b-v1fp32plan-error-no-such-file-or-directory)

If you're on windows, you need to also pay attention to the syntax too, 
see [FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#a4-syntax-error-windows)

and run the mcts_main (not start.sh) with the needed parameters, 
see an example 
[here](https://github.com/wonderingabout/goreviewpartner/blob/config-profiles-phoenixgo/config.ini#L100-L116)

also, see [#86](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/86) and [#99](https://github.com/pnprog/goreviewpartner/issues/99) for details

#### A3. There are too much log.

Passing `--v=0` to `mcts_main` will turn off many debug log.
Moreover, `--minloglevel=1` and `--minloglevel=2` could disable INFO log and WARNING log.

Or, if you just don't want to log to stderr, replace `--logtostderr` to `--log_dir={log_dir}`,
then you could read your log from `{log_dir}/mcts_main.INFO`.

#### A4. Syntax error (Windows)

For windows,
- in config file, 

you need to write path with `/` and not `\` in the config file .conf, for example : 

```
model_config {
      train_dir: "c:/users/amd2018/Downloads/PhoenixGo/ckpt"
```

- in cmd.exe,

Here you need to write paths with `\` and not `/`. 
Also command format on windows needs a space and not a `=`, for example : 

`mcts_main.exe --gtp --config_path C:\Users\amd2018\Downloads\PhoenixGo\etc\mcts_1gpu_notensorrt.conf`

or if you want to show the PV, you need to remove the `=` too, for example : 

`mcts_main.exe --gtp --config_path C:\Users\amd2018\Downloads\PhoenixGo\etc\mcts_1gpu_notensorrt.conf --logtostderr --v 1`

See next point below :

#### A5. '"ckpt/zero.ckpt-20b-v1.FP32.PLAN"' error: No such file or directory

This fix works for all systems : Linux, Mac, Windows, only the name of the ckpt file changes. 
Modify your config file and write the full path of your ckpt directory, for example for linux : 

```
model_config {
    train_dir: "/home/amd2018/PhoenixGo/ckpt"
```
    
for example, for windows :

```
model_config {
    train_dir: "c:/users/amd2018/Downloads/PhoenixGo/ckpt"
```

if you use tensorRT (linux only, and compatible nvidia GPU only), also change path of tensorRT, for example :

```
model_config {
    train_dir: "/home/amd2018/PhoenixGo/ckpt/"
    enable_tensorrt: 1
    tensorrt_model_path: "/home/amd2018/test/PhoenixGo/ckpt/zero.ckpt-20b-v1.FP32.PLAN"
}
```

#### A6. How to run with Sabaki?

Setting GTP engine in Sabaki's menu: `Engines -> Manage Engines`, fill `Path` with path of `start.sh`.
Click `Engines -> Attach` to use the engine in your game.
See also [#22](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/22).

#### A7. How make PhoenixGo think with longer/shorter time?

Modify `timeout_ms_per_step` in your config file.

#### A8. How make PhoenixGo think with constant time per move?

Modify your config file. `early_stop`, `unstable_overtime`, `behind_overtime` and
`time_control` are options that affect the search time, remove them if exist then
each move will cost constant time/simulations.

#### A9. What is the speed of the engine ? How can i make the engine think faster ?

GPU is much faster to compute than CPU (but only nvidia GPU are supported)

TensorRT also increases significantly the speed of computation, but it is only 
available for linux with a compatible nvidia GPU

Bigger batch size significantly increases the speed of the computation, but a bigger 
batch size puts a bigger burden on the computation device (in case it is the GPU, 
higher GPU load, higher VRAM usage), increase it only if your computation device can handle it

Some independent speed benchmarks have been run, they are available in the docs :

- for GTX 1060 :  
[benchmark testing batch size from 4 to 64, tree size up to 2000M, max children up to 512, with tensorRT ON and OFF](/docs/benchmark-gtx1060.md)

#### A10. GTP command `time_settings` doesn't work.

Add these lines in your config:

```
time_control {
    enable: 1
    c_denom: 20
    c_maxply: 40
    reserved_time: 1.0
}
```

`c_denom` and `c_maxply` are parameters for deciding how to use the "main time".
`reserved_time` is how many seconds should reserved (for network latency) in "byo-yomi time".

#### A11. GTP command error : `invalid command`

Some GTP commands are not supported by PhoenixGo, for example the `showboard` command. 

To know supported GTP commands, start phoenixgo in GTP mode and enter the GTP command `list_commands`

Result as of today is : 

```
version
protocol_version
list_commands
quit
clear_board
boardsize
komi
time_settings
time_left
place_free_handicap
set_free_handicap
play
genmove
final_score
get_debug_info
get_last_move_debug_info
```

If you use unsupported commands the engine will not work. Make sure your GTP tool 
does not communicate with PhoenixGo with unsupported GTP commands.

For example, for [gtp2ogs](https://github.com/online-go/gtp2ogs) server command line GTP tool,
you need to edit the file gtp2ogs.js and manually remove the existing `showboard` line if it 
is not already done, 
[see](https://github.com/online-go/gtp2ogs/commit/d5ebdbbde259a97c5ae1aed0ec42a07c9fbb2dbf)

#### A12. The game does not start, error : `unacceptable komi`

With the default settings, the only komi value supported is only 7.5, with chinese rules only.
If it is not automated, you need to manually set komi value to 7.5 with chinese rules.

If you want to implement PhoenixGo to a server where players play with different komi values 
(for example 6.5, 0.5, 85.5, 200.5,etc), you need to force komi to 7.5 for the players. 

If it is not possible, there is a workaround you can use : configure you GTP tool to tell 
PhoenixGo engine that the komi for the game is 7.5 even if it is not true

if you do that, the game will not be scored correctly because PhoenixGo will think that 
the komi is 7.5 while the real komi is different, but at least PhoenixGo will be able to
play the game. 
An example for [gtp2ogs](https://github.com/online-go/gtp2ogs) is provided 
[here](https://github.com/wonderingabout/gtp2ogs-tutorial/blob/master/docs/3A4-linux-optional-edit-gtp2ogs-js-file.md) 
and [here](https://github.com/wonderingabout/gtp2ogs-tutorial/blob/master/docs/3B4-windows-optional-edit-gtp2ogs-js-file.md)

information : the BensonDarr on [FoxGo server](http://weiqi.qq.com/) is able to play with 6.5 komi
because it has been modified, but this is not true for the PhoenixGo engine provided here.

#### A13. I have a nvidia RTX card (Turing) or Tesla V100/Titan V (Volta), is it compatible ?

##### RTX cards (Turing) :

- need CUDA 10.0 or higher (so currently, only linux is supported, or windows with your own building)
- If you compile PhoenixGo, it has been tested to work on linux [here](/docs/tested-versions.md) 
with CUDA 10.0, cudnn 7.4.2, ubuntu 18.04.
- However currently there is no tensorRT support for PhoenixGo (RTX cards require tensorRT 5.x or more
(and this also requires tensorflow 1.9 or more), which is currently not supported by PhoenixGo)

##### Volta cards (Tesla V100 / Titan V and similar)

- are compatible with cuda 9.0 and higher (it is recommended to use latest version when possible),
cudnn 7.1.x or higher (x is any number)
- has been tested to work successfully on windows
- However currently there is no tensorRT support for PhoenixGo (Tesla V100 has been tested not to work
with PhoenixGo tensorrt 3.0.4)

### Specific questions : building with bazel questions (linux and mac)

#### B1. I am getting errors during bazel configure, bazel building, and/or running PhoenixGo engine

If you built with bazel, see : 
[Most common path errors during cuda/cudnn install and bazel configure](/docs/path-errors.md)

See also [minimalist bazel configure](/docs/minimalist-bazel-configure.md) for an example 
of build configure

If you are still getting errors, try using an older version of bazel. 
For example bazel 0.20.0 is known to cause issues, and **bazel 0.11.1 is known good**

#### B2. The PhoenixGo and bazel folders are too big

During the bazel building, there are many options that can are not required and can be disabled

This will reduce building time and will have smaller size after the building, 
see [minimalist bazel configure](/docs/minimalist-bazel-configure.md) and 
[#76](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/76)

#### B3. I cannot increase batch size to more than 4 with TensorRT (linux only) : errors

Increasing batch size in the config file makes the engine compute faster, 
as explained earlier in 
[FAQ question](/docs/FAQ.md/#6-what-is-the-speed-of-the-engine--how-can-i-make-the-engine-think-faster-)

However, with default building, you cannot use batch size higher than 4 with tensorRT
To increase batch size for example to 32 with tensorRT enabled, you need to build tensorrt model
with bazel, See : [#75](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/75)

#### B4. How to remove entirely all PhoenixGo and bazel files and folders ?

assuming you installed PhoenixGo in home directory (`~` or `/home/yourusername/`)

```
# clean with bazel
cd ~/PhoenixGo && bazel clean
# remove PhoenixGo local directory
sudo rm -rf ~/PhoenixGo
# remove any remaining bazel file
sudo rm -rf ~/.cache/bazel
```
This will free a few GB (arround 3-6 GB depending on your installation settings)
