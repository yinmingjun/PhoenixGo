**PhoenixGo** is an Go AI program which implement the AlphaGo Zero paper
"[Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge](https://deepmind.com/documents/119/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf)".
It is also known as "BensonDarr" in FoxGo, "cronus" in CGOS,
and the champion of "World AI Go Tournament 2018" held in Fuzhou China.

If you use PhoenixGo in your project, please consider mentioning in your README.

If you use PhoenixGo in your research, please consider citing the library as follows:

## Building and Running

### On Linux

#### Requirements

* GCC with C++11 support
* Bazel (0.11.1 is known-good)
* (Optional) CUDA and cuDNN (for GPU support)
* (Optional) TensorRT (for accelerating computation on GPU, 3.0.4 is known-good)

#### Building

Clone the repository and configure the building:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo.git
$ cd PhoenixGo
$ ./configure
```

`./configure` will ask where CUDA and TensorRT have been installed, specify them if need.

Then build with bazel:

```
$ bazel build //mcts:mcts_main
```

Dependices such as Tensorflow will be downloaded automatically. The building prosess may take a long time.

#### Running

Download and extract the trained network, then run:

```
$ wget https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/releases/download/trained-network-20b-v1/trained-network-20b-v1.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf trained-network-20b-v1.tar.gz
$ scripts/start.sh
```

`start.sh` will detect the number of GPUs, run `mcts_main` with proper config file, and write log files in directory `log`.
You could also use a customized config by running `scripts/start.sh {config_path}`.
See also [#configure-guide](#configure-guide).

Furthermore, if you want to fully control all the options of `mcts_main` (such as, changing log destination),
you could also run `bazel-bin/mcts/mcts_main` directly. See also [#command-line-options](#command-line-options).

The engine supports the GTP protocol, means it could be used with a GUI with GTP capability,
such as [Sabaki](http://sabaki.yichuanshen.de).

#### Distribute mode

PhoenixGo support running with distributed workers, if there are GPUs on different machine.

Build the distribute worker:

```
$ bazel build //dist:dist_zero_model_server
```

Run `dist_zero_model_server` on distributed worker, **one for each GPU**.

```
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES={gpu} bazel-bin/dist/dist_zero_model_server --server_address="0.0.0.0:{port}" --logtostderr
```

Fill `ip:port` of workers in the config file (`etc/mcts_dist.conf` is an example config for 32 workers),
and run the distributed master:

```
$ scripts/start.sh etc/mcts_dist.conf
```

### On macOS

**Note: Tensorflow stop providing GPU support on macOS since 1.2.0, so you are only able to run on CPU.**

## Configure Guide

Here are some important options in the config file:

* `num_eval_threads`: should equal to the number of GPUs
* `num_search_threads`: should a bit larger than `num_eval_threads * eval_batch_size`
* `timeout_ms_per_step`: how many time will used for each move
* `max_simulations_per_step`: how many simulations will do for each move
* `gpu_list`: use which GPUs, sperated by comma
* `model_config -> train_dir`: directory where trained network stored
* `model_config -> checkpoint_path`: use which checkpoint, get from `train_dir/checkpoint` if not set
* `model_config -> enable_tensorrt`: use TensorRT or not
* `model_config -> tensorrt_model_path`: use which TensorRT model, if `enable_tensorrt`
* `max_search_tree_size`: the maximum number of tree nodes, change it depends on memory size
* `max_children_per_node`: the maximum children of each node, change it depends on memory size
* `enable_background_search`: pondering in opponent's time
* `early_stop`: genmove may return before `timeout_ms_per_step`, if the result would not change any more
* `unstable_overtime`: think `timeout_ms_per_step * time_factor` more if the result still unstable
* `behind_overtime`: think `timeout_ms_per_step * time_factor` more if winrate less than `act_threshold`

Options for distribute mode:

* `enable_dist`: enable distribute mode
* `dist_svr_addrs`: `ip:port` of distributed workers, multiple lines, one `ip:port` in each line
* `dist_config -> timeout_ms`: RPC timeout

Options for async distribute mode:

> Async mode is used when there are huge number of distributed workers (more than 200),
> which need too many eval threads and search threads in sync mode.
> `etc/mcts_async_dist.conf` is an example config for 256 workers.

* `enable_async`: enable async mode
* `enable_dist`: enable distribute mode
* `dist_svr_addrs`: multiple lines, comma sperated lists of `ip:port` for each line
* `num_eval_threads`: should equal to number of `dist_svr_addrs` lines
* `eval_task_queue_size`: tunning depend on number of distribute workers
* `num_search_threads`: tunning depend on number of distribute workers

## Command Line Options

`mcts_main` accept options from command line:

* `--config_path`: path of config file
* `--gtp`: run as a GTP engine, if disable, gen next move only
* `--init_moves`: initial moves on the go board
* `--gpu_list`: override `gpu_list` in config file
* `--listen_port`: work with `--gtp`, run gtp engine on port in TCP protocol
* `--allow_ip`: work with `--listen_port`, list of client ip allowed to connect
* `--fork_per_request`: work with `--listen_port`, fork for each request or not

Glog options are also supported:

* `--logtostderr`: log message to stderr
* `--log_dir`: log to files in this directory
* `--minloglevel`: log level, 0 - INFO, 1 - WARNING, 2 - ERROR
* `--v`: verbose log, `--v=1` for turning on some debug log, `--v=0` to turning off

`mcts_main --help` for more command line options.

## FAQ

**1. Where is the win rate?**

Print in the log, something like:

<pre>
I0514 12:51:32.724236 14467 mcts_engine.cc:157] 1th move(b): dp, <b>winrate=44.110905%</b>, N=654, Q=-0.117782, p=0.079232, v=-0.116534, cost 39042.679688ms, sims=7132, height=11, avg_height=5.782244, global_step=639200
</pre>

**2. There are too much log.**

Passing `--v=0` to `mcts_main` will turn off many debug log.
Moreover, `--minloglevel=1` and `--minloglevel=2` could disable INFO log and WARNING log.

Or, if you just don't want to log to stderr, replace `--logtostderr` to `--log_dir={log_dir}`,
then you could read your log from `{log_dir}/mcts_main.INFO`.

**3. How to run with Sabaki?**

Setting GTP engine in Sabaki's menu: `Engines -> Manage Engines`, fill `Path` with path of `start.sh`.
Click `Engines -> Attach` to use the engine in your game.
See also [#22](https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/22).

**4. How make PhoenixGo think with longer/shorter time?**

Modify `timeout_ms_per_step` in your config file.

**5. How make PhoenixGo think with constant time per move?**

Modify your config file. `early_stop`, `unstable_overtime`, `behind_overtime` and
`time_control` are options that affect the search time, remove them if exist then
each move will cost constant time/simulations.

**6. GTP command `time_settings` doesn't work.**

Add these lines in your config:

```
time_control {
    enable: 1
    c_denom: 20
    c_maxply: 40
    reserved_time: 1.0
}
```

`c_denom` and `c_maxply` are parameters for deciding how to use the "main time".
`reserved_time` is how many seconds should reserved (for network latency) in "byo-yomi time".
